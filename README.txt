This is my neovim config, if you are on linux you can just

* Install nvim https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim
* Clone this repo into your nvim config folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scutta2000/nvim ~/.config/nvim/
```

* Open up nvim in any terminal and run `:PackerSync`
